## Data Science Study Group

Welcome! We are a group of individuals interested in exploring data science as a means to help build an egalitarian and free society. This page will serve as a running log of weekly sessions, resources, and learning materials.

### Why data science?

The internet is probably not going away anytime soon, neither is social media. In the past few decades, society has changed profoundly, and as such our movements for self-determination should use every tool available to better understand the communities, institutions, and interactions we are a part of or affected by. To this end, data science is profoundly powerful and should be considered a part of any group's toolkit.

### How can I get involved?

Just follow along with this page! We'll be posting readings, notes & projects as we go along. If you have anything to add or suggestions, send us a message or a pull request on github and we'll take a look! :)

##### Code of Conduct
